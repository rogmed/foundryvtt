 * Computes a contour for a given input grid function using the <a

 *
 * @param grid a two-input function(x, y) that returns true for values
 * inside the contour and false for values outside the contour.
 * @param start an optional starting point [x, y] on the grid.
 * @returns polygon [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], â€¦]
