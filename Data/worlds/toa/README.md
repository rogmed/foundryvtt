# Tomb of Annihilation (toa)

<p>A shocking rumor buzzes through the Forgotten Realms; a mysterious affliction is targeting those who have been raised from the dead. This wasting disease, which marches its victims back toward the death they once defied, has been dubbed the &#34;death curse&#34;. When this wretched sorcery claims a life, divine magic no longer revives them. Any others who fall to their demise, through natural or unnatural causes, is similarly lost to the living realm.</p><p>Adventurers who wish to stop this devastation must travel to the peninsula of Chult to find the source of this death curse and destroy it. Chult is a tropical wilderness composed mostly of jungles, plateaus, impassable mountains, and belching volcanoes.</p><p>Tomb of Annihilation is a Dungeons &amp; Dragons fifth edition adventure designed to begin with a party of four to six 1st-level characters, who should advance to 11th level or higher by the story's conclusion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Foundry Enhancements:</h3><ul><li>Rotating Map Tokens to represent spinning room features.</li><li>Players' map of Chult with revealable areas that become unveiled as the party explores this vast new land.</li><li>Interactive player puzzles.</li><li>Rollable Tables for all shapeshifters, and Rollable Tables and Macro Options for all random encounters.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Product Information</h3><blockquote><ul><li>System: <strong>D&amp;D 5E (Forgotten Realms)</strong></li><li>Starting Level: <strong>Low (1)</strong></li><li>Length: <strong>Long Campaign</strong></li></ul></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> The use of this is meant for use for your personal use, and only if you legally possess such in accordance with your local laws.</p>

## Version

v2.0.1

## Setup from Manifest

In Foundry, you can add the world using one of the links for the `world.json` file:

- [world.json from main gateway](https://41153fa2.nip.io/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dl9338fpk7jrfx20ayprickx11r7fpyyna5v2982yk404c6q0mo/toa/toa-2.0.1/world.json)
- [world.json from backup gateway](https://ipfs.io/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dl9338fpk7jrfx20ayprickx11r7fpyyna5v2982yk404c6q0mo/toa/toa-2.0.1/gateway.json)

## Setup from Zip

You can download the zip files from one of the following gateways:

- [toa-2.0.1.zip from main gateway](https://41153fa2.nip.io/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dl9338fpk7jrfx20ayprickx11r7fpyyna5v2982yk404c6q0mo/toa/toa-2.0.1/toa-2.0.1.zip)
- [toa-2.0.1.zip from backup gateway](https://ipfs.io/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dl9338fpk7jrfx20ayprickx11r7fpyyna5v2982yk404c6q0mo/toa/toa-2.0.1/toa-2.0.1.zip)

The folder toa must be pasted in your `\Data\worlds\` folder.

The folder tree must be: `\Data\worlds\toa\<world files>`. Therefore, the `json` should be located at `\Data\worlds\toa\json`.

Be careful with the zip version; DO NOT paste the folder as: `\Data\worlds\toa\toa\json`
