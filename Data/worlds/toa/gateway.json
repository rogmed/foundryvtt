    "description": "<p>A shocking rumor buzzes through the Forgotten Realms; a mysterious affliction is targeting those who have been raised from the dead. This wasting disease, which marches its victims back toward the death they once defied, has been dubbed the &#34;death curse&#34;. When this wretched sorcery claims a life, divine magic no longer revives them. Any others who fall to their demise, through natural or unnatural causes, is similarly lost to the living realm.</p><p>Adventurers who wish to stop this devastation must travel to the peninsula of Chult to find the source of this death curse and destroy it. Chult is a tropical wilderness composed mostly of jungles, plateaus, impassable mountains, and belching volcanoes.</p><p>Tomb of Annihilation is a Dungeons &amp; Dragons fifth edition adventure designed to begin with a party of four to six 1st-level characters, who should advance to 11th level or higher by the story's conclusion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Foundry Enhancements:</h3><ul><li>Rotating Map Tokens to represent spinning room features.</li><li>Players' map of Chult with revealable areas that become unveiled as the party explores this vast new land.</li><li>Interactive player puzzles.</li><li>Rollable Tables for all shapeshifters, and Rollable Tables and Macro Options for all random encounters.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Product Information</h3><blockquote><ul><li>System: <strong>D&amp;D 5E (Forgotten Realms)</strong></li><li>Starting Level: <strong>Low (1)</strong></li><li>Length: <strong>Long Campaign</strong></li></ul></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> The use of this is meant for use for your personal use, and only if you legally possess such in accordance with your local laws.</p>",
